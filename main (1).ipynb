    "**Applying ML to the NBA Draft**\n",
    "\n",
    "On Thursday June 22nd, 2023, the San Antonio Spurs selected Victor Wembanyama with their first overall pick. With other prospective stars such as Scoot Henderson and the Thompson twins in this year’s draft, this appeared to be one of the most exciting draft classes in recent memory. As an NBA fan and a data analyst, I became extremely curious about the analytics that goes behind each pick. While high picks often translate to the best players, there have been a multitude of cases throughout the years in which teams have made the wrong choices with their first overall selection. At the same time, lower picks have proven to be valuable if a team is able to aptly predict future stardom.Thus, I developed a machine learning model that will predict where each player should be drafted in their respective classes by feeding college stats data and NBA draft combine data. "

    "**Variables Used‍**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the parameters of my model, I used the following Kaggle datasets with player’s respective college statistics and draft combine data.  The college stats includes metrics like field goal percentage, points per game, and more intricate parameters like player efficiency rating, win shares, defensisve and offensive BPM, etc. NBA Draft Combine data presents an overview of a player's physical prowess and athletic capabilities, offering indicators such as height, weight, wingspan, and results from various physical tests like the max vertical leap and sprint time. ‍The greatest challenge was choosing an appropriate response variable. For this task, I wanted to pick a variable that would accurately predict success in the NBA, a variable that real time scouts and analysts hope to use in the draft. I chose, RAPTOR, a stat developed by sports scientists from the writers of FiveThirtyEight that is described as follows:‍‍\n",
    "\n",
    "“RAPTOR consists of two major components that are blended together to rate players: a “box” (as in “box score”) component, which uses individual statistics (including statistics derived from player tracking and play-by-play data), and an “on-off” component, which evaluates a team’s performance when the player and various combinations of his teammates are on or off the floor.NBA teams highly value floor spacing, defense and shot creation, and they place relatively little value on traditional big-man skills. RAPTOR likewise values these things — not because we made any deliberate attempt to design the system that way but because the importance of those skills emerges naturally from the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "RAPTOR thinks ball-dominant players such as James Harden and Steph Curry are phenomenally good. It highly values two-way wings such as Kawhi Leonard and Paul George. It can have a love-hate relationship with centers, who are sometimes overvalued in other statistical systems. But it appreciates modern centers such as Nikola Jokić and Joel Embiid, as well as defensive stalwarts like Rudy Gobert.”\n",
    "\n",
    "I used their RAPTOR WAR variation, which includes minutes played and games played as a factor, as teams are looking for players that can be effective throughout an 82 game season with sufficient playing time. "

    "Abstract: This code utilizes machine learning models to predict the career performance of NBA players. The code incorporates data preprocessing, imputation, model training, and prediction steps. It calculates the average of the seven best seasons to balance the importance of peak performance and longevity. The trained models are evaluated, and the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model is chosen as the best performer. The code applies the OLS model to a test set of NBA players and compares the predicted career performance with the actual performance. "

    "**WAR Total Calculation**\n",
    "\n",
    "While WAR is already an established metric, finding an average career WAR would undervalue players that play past their primes. Players like Vince Carter who was a perrennial All-Star during his time with the Raptors will have a mediocre average WAR due to his time as a 40-year-old veteran. If we calculate the sum, it will likewise overvalue these players - most franchises would have one all-star player for one year over a bad player for three, even if their cumulative WAR is the same. Thus, I chose to find the average of the 7 best WAR seasons, balancing the importance of peak and longevity. "

    "Finally, I applied my model to the test set and predicted the WAR of 90 randomized NBA players. After looking at the top 10 war_total_pred, it is clear that the model is not entirely perfect. The top 3 players, Marcus Smart, Donte DiVincenzo, and Andre Roberson all appear to be of the same build - versatile defenders who can provide valuable spacing for their teammates. However, they are a clear tier below Hall of Fame players in the test set, like James Harden and Kawhi Leonard, with a predicted 7-year WAR a fifth of their actual WAR. One potential reason for this is that both these players developed into a mold completely different from their college careers. Kawhi Leonard was touted as a 3-D and wing straight out of San Diego State, but developed unique skills that led him to stardome. Similarly, James Harden was expected to become a sparkplug 6th man coming out of Arizona State, before eventually changing the game of basketball forever with his impressive scoring. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most of these players with a high predicted WAR had long, illustrious careers in the NBA. However, there are also players within the top 10 predicted WAR who did not translate to quality NBA players. Lester Hudson is a prime example. The ML recognized his outstanding college stats (Hudson is the only player to record a quadruble double in NCAA D1 sports with (25 points, 12 rebounds, 10 assists and 10 steals vs. Central Baptist College), but could not gauge differences in division/competition. Thus, despite a high predicted WAR, Hudson was picked with the 58th pick and only played a total of 57 NBA games. \n"

    "The first draft class I wanted to observe was 2012, with multiple all-stars that were picked in the second round. My predictive model puts Draymond Green as the number two prospect right below Anthony Davis. While it is debatable on whether he is better all-time than Damian Lillard, he is a clear tier above the rest of the players he is placed above. I found it interesting that my model was able to predict Draymond's future success solely based off of his college success and draft combine stats while only being the 35th overall pick. Furthermore, it placed Khris Middleton, another All-Star picked in the second round, within the top 10 draft picks, which proves that it is a useful tool in discovering underrated talent.  "

    "I also looked at the 2009 draft class, touted as one of the strongest draft classes of the past decade. Interestingly, it puts Stephen Curry as the first overall pick in a draft where he famously dropped to 7th overall. One advantage and disadvantage of this model is the fact that it does not consider injury history. Thus, the ML model overlooks Curry's injuries in college and correctly puts him at the first overall pick. This may be disadvantageous with other players, who sustained injuries through college and continue to sustain them throughout their NBA careers. The model also accurately predicts the impact of Jrue Holiday, who was a 17th overall pick but has provided all-star quality level play and Hall-of-Fame level defense for teams around the league. While he is not a better performer than James Harden, it is likely due to RAPTOR's value of defense that causes him to be so high. "
